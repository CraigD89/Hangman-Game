Pseudo-code for Hangman Game

NOTES/ISSUES
- I should have used classes to group styling elements over individual ids for everything
- I want to find a way to link the current image to the current word (when number is generated)
- Having issues with the order of JS
	- Which functions go inside where for the best result?
- Can't get keyup function to work properly
	- Possibly something in my JS preventing it from working
		- Order of JS?
- Could not get to the point of adding number to wins or reset for loss, but wrote if/else statements



HTML/CSS
- Create aesthetic for the page
	- Classical art theme
- Central graphics for game

LAYOUT + LOGIC
- Wrapper for layout X
- Header with game title X
	- Renaissance font X 
- Two columns for game layout
	- Left column
		- Image of the game's current word
			- Logic: Pull random number (word) from an array and link image to word
	- Right column
		- "Press any key to get started!"X
		- "# of wins"
			- Logic: calculate number of words guessed correctly
		- "Current word"
			- Logic: Pull random number (word) from an array
		- "Number of guesses remaining"
			- Logic: calculate number of incorrect guesses and subtract from 10
		- "Letters guessed"
			- Logic: if user guesses an incorrect letter, display that letter here



JAVASCRIPT
Word topic
- Art terms

Create an array of words
- 7 different words of art movements

Script that chooses a random number for the array when the user starts the game

User inputs a letter
- var for letter
	- Is the letter in the game's word?
		- IF TRUE - adds input letter to the appropriate space
		- IF FALSE - user loses one chance
			- Display guessed letter under "letters used"

User guesses again until win/loss



JAVASCRIPT ORDER !!!

- variable for Letters
- variable for words

- randomly generated word
- answerArray for each letter
	- for (var i = 0; i < word.length; i++)
- letters correct
- letters incorrect

User guess
- addEventListener for input letter from user

Loop
- if user's guess is true - display correct letter on screen
- else user's guess is incorrect - display incorrect letter on screen and lose one guessed

- if user guesses correctly - add 1 to win streak
